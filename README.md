Hi, my name is Airel Dave Pasco, and this is my first ever project as a first-year IT college student at PLMUN. This project represents my initial foray into web development, created over the span of 1 month and 3 weeks as my final project for the first year of my College and IT life.
I have no proper background because I'm a STEM Student in Senior High School until I am required to get in as an IT Student in PLMUN. So much self-learn to catch up and here I am to show you my first project.
## Project Overview

## Features
